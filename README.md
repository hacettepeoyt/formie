# formie

Open source form application made with pure HTML/CSS/JS. Needs minimal client-side JS for form creation.

## Setup

Python 3.9+ is required to run Formie. If you are running Formie for a development build, you can just run `make run`.

If you are planning on running Formie on production, I'd advise looking at my [PKGBUILDs](https://github.com/div72/PKGBUILDs/tree/development/formie) repo.
